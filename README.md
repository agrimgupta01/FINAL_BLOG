My github repository for the Seasons of Code (SoC) 2022 project : Blogified, in which we had to make a full-stack blog posting website in Django.
I built a full - stack web application in Django and HTML, styled it with Bootstrap and CSS and deployed it on Heroku cloud platform using Whitenoise package.
In first 3 weeks I followed the chapters of the book, and then followed the online playlist of Codemy.com to create my website.
final-env folder has the virtual environment setup files and final_blog folder has multiple folders containing relevant and necessary files for website.
The name of the app is final_app and another app called members has been created for user signup, login and authentication. 
The templates directory has been created in respective folders.
